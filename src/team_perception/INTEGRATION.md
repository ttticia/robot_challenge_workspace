# Integrating `team_perception` on the robot

What the perception package needs from the robot, what it publishes, and how to use its
outputs. For installing and building, see [README.md](README.md).

## In short

```bash
ros2 launch team_perception robot.launch.py depth_topic:=<depth aligned to colour>
```

One launch file starts three nodes. To know when the robot has found something, listen
to **`/found`**: it carries `QR found` or `Human found`, once per new find. For *what*
was found and *where*, read `/qr/detections` and `/posters/detections` (JSON in a
`std_msgs/String`).

```
 camera colour ──┬─────────────► qr_scanner ───────► /qr/detections, /found "QR found"
                 │
                 └─► human_detector ─► /humans/detections ─► poster_detector ─► /posters/detections
                                                                   ▲            /found "Human found"
 camera depth (aligned) ─► qr_scanner, human_detector, poster_detector
 camera_info, TF camera→map, /map ───────────────────────────────┘
```

## What the robot must provide

| Input | Type | Used by | If it's missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Colour image: `/camera/color/image_raw/compressed` (or raw with `image_transport:=raw`) | `sensor_msgs/CompressedImage` or `Image` | all detection | Nothing is detected. |
| Depth image **aligned to the colour image**, 16UC1 mm or 32FC1 m | `sensor_msgs/Image` | positions; the poster test | QR codes still reported, with no position. **Posters are never confirmed.** |
| Colour camera intrinsics: `/camera/color/camera_info` | `sensor_msgs/CameraInfo` | positions | No positions. |
| TF from the camera optical frame to `map` (from localisation) | TF | positions in `map`; the map test | Positions come out in the camera frame (it says so in `frame`), and the map test is skipped. |
| Static map: `/map`, transient local, built **without people in it** | `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid` | the poster map test (`map_mode`) | With the default `veto`, the depth test decides alone. |

**"Aligned" matters.** The depth stream must cover the same view and pixel grid as the colour image: the same
intrinsics in its `camera_info`. In the 2026-11-12 teleop bag, `/camera/depth/image_raw` is **not**
aligned (depth fx = 373, colour fx = 462). Pointing `poster_detector` at it gave about a quarter as many poster
labels and confirmed the poster 21 s later than aligned depth did. Turn on depth-to-colour alignment in the
camera driver with its `depth_registration` setting. The steps are in [CAMERA_ALIGNMENT.md](CAMERA_ALIGNMENT.md).
To check it: the depth topic's `camera_info` should then match `/camera/color/camera_info`.

> **Open question: the depth topic.** `robot.launch.py` still uses `/camera/depth/image_raw` by default.
> Before relying on posters, check on the robot whether that topic is aligned (compare the two
> `camera_info` topics as above), and pass the aligned topic as `depth_topic:=...` if it isn't.

Check every topic name with `ros2 topic list` and override with launch arguments
(`ros2 launch team_perception robot.launch.py --show-args`).

## What it publishes

All outputs use the default QoS (reliable, volatile, depth 10). **A node that subscribes late misses
earlier messages**, so start listeners before the run or together with the launch.

### `/found` — `std_msgs/String`

The simplest interface: plain text, no JSON.

| Message | Sent by | When |
|---|---|---|
| `QR found` | `qr_scanner` | Once per new code text, per run. |
| `Human found` | `poster_detector` | Once per new **poster** position (posters within `merge_radius_m` = 0.5 m count as the same one). Real people never trigger it. |

Other tools match these exact strings, so they must not change.

### `/qr/detections` — `std_msgs/String` (JSON)

One message when a code is first read, then again every `repeat_after_s` (30 s) while it is still in view.

```json
{"text": "I", "pixel": [412.5, 133.0], "frame": "map",
 "position": [1.84, 0.62, 0.41], "snapshot": "/home/<user>/qr_logs/qr_1794488686123.jpg",
 "stamp": 1794488686.12}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `text` | Decoded content of the code. |
| `pixel` | Centre of the code in the colour image (px). |
| `frame` | Frame of `position`: `map` normally, or the camera optical frame when there is no TF. Without depth it is `none`. |
| `position` | `[x, y, z]` in metres, or `null` without depth. |
| `snapshot` | Annotated image of the find, saved on the robot. |
| `stamp` | Time of the camera image (s). |

### `/posters/detections` — `std_msgs/String` (JSON)

One message when a poster of a person is **confirmed** (by default 5 of its last 8 frames
say poster), then again every `repeat_after_s` (60 s) while it is still in view.

```json
{"stamp": 1794488687.09, "id": 1, "frame": "map", "position": [1.67, 0.77, -0.08],
 "votes": "5/5", "conf": 0.719, "box": [7.0, 95.0, 46.0, 191.0],
 "ring": "surface continues past the edges", "map": "on/next to a static surface in the map"}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Track number. It can change if the poster is out of view for more than 30 s, so use `position` to tell posters apart. |
| `frame`, `position` | As above: `map` if TF is available, otherwise the camera frame. |
| `votes` | Poster votes over the recent frames of this track. |
| `conf` | YOLO person confidence (0–1). |
| `box` | `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` in colour-image pixels. |
| `ring`, `map` | Short reasons from the depth-edge test and the static-map test. `map` is `null` when the map test is off, and `no tf to map` when there is no TF. |

### `/humans/detections` — `std_msgs/String` (JSON)

The raw person detections that feed `poster_detector`: up to 10 messages a second, and only in frames with
someone in view. It includes **real people as well as posters**, so the mission logic should
normally use `/posters/detections` instead.

```json
{"stamp": 1794488687.09, "frame_id": "camera_color_optical_frame", "image_size": [640, 480],
 "count": 1, "people": [{"box": [7.0, 95.0, 46.0, 191.0], "conf": 0.719,
 "pixel": [26.5, 133.4], "frame": "map", "position": [1.67, 0.77, -0.08]}]}
```

## Files written on the robot

These are created on the first find, outside the workspace:

| Folder | Content |
|---|---|
| `~/qr_logs/` | `qr_<timestamp>.csv` (one row per report) and an annotated snapshot per report. |
| `~/poster_logs/` | `posters_<timestamp>.csv` (one row per confirmed poster report). No images. |

## Integrating it

1. **Start it** with the robot's other software, for example by including
   `robot.launch.py` from the robot's main launch file, with the topic names set as launch
   arguments. `qr:=false` or `posters:=false` turns off one half.
2. **Before it starts**, make sure the camera driver publishes aligned depth, localisation
   publishes TF to `map`, and the static map is on `/map`.
3. **Use the outputs.** For a counter or a score display, subscribe to `/found`. To mark finds on the
   map or to record them for scoring, subscribe to `/qr/detections` and `/posters/detections` and
   parse the JSON. For example:

   ```python
   import json
   from std_msgs.msg import String

   def on_poster(msg: String):
       p = json.loads(msg.data)
       if p['frame'] == 'map':
           mark_victim(p['position'][:2])      # x, y in the map

   node.create_subscription(String, '/posters/detections', on_poster, 10)
   ```

4. **CPU load.** Everything runs on the CPU. YOLO takes about 50–100 ms per 640 px frame on the dev laptop, and
   `human_detector` is limited to 10 frames a second (`rate_hz`). Lower `rate_hz` or `imgsz` if the robot's
   computer can't keep up. The QR decoder runs at up to 30 frames a second.
5. **Limits to know about.**
   - The poster thresholds have been checked on only one teleop bag so far: one poster, confirmed
     correctly, no false posters.
   - Beyond 4 m (`max_range_m`), depth is too noisy and a person counts as unknown, never as a poster.
   - Positions are only as good as localisation and the camera-to-base TF.
